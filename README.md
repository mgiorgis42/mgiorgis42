### Hi there. 👋🏾 I'm Moses. Thank you for stopping by my GitHub profile.
- A little bit about me:
  1. 💻 I am an undergraduate student studying Data Science at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA.
  2. 🌱 I am addicted to learning and growing everyday.
  3. 😅 I am fairly novice to the field of Data Science and am still fascinated with the applications and success of 'hard' sciences over social sciences.
