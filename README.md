### Hi there. 👋🏾 I'm Moses. Thank you for stopping by my GitHub profile.
- A little bit about me:
  1. 💻 I am an undergraduate student studying Data Science at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA.
  2. 🌱 I am addicted to learning and growing everyday.
  3. 🚧 Lastly, I spend much of my free time actively learning JavaScript so that I can grow my developing skills.
